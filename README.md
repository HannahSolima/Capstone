# Capstone
This capstone will compare IMDbâ€™s Top 250 movies to Rotten Tomatoes scoring. People tend to prefer one over the other, but is this simply a preference or are there notable differences? I plan to webscrape, analyze and create visuals in Python and then have an interactive dashboard in PowerBI.
